# What is *Smartlabsuniminuto*?

*Smartlabsuniminuto*  is an initiative about remote laboratories for teaching and learning programming and control systems in academic programs of engineering and technology. The project was developed at the university Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios-UNIMINUTO ([https://www.uniminuto.edu/](https://www.uniminuto.edu/)) , Bogotá, Colombia, involving the programs of Technology in Electronics, Systems Engineering, and Industrial Engineering. 

The laboratory arose according to the educational problems regarding experimentation, hands-on activities, and learning by doing produced by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The laboratory is focused on programming through Python Language and a beta version for control systems education with a level control plant. Among the main features of *Smartlabsuniminuto*, we have:
