# 1. What is *Smartlabsuniminuto*?

*Smartlabsuniminuto*  is an initiative about remote laboratories for teaching and learning programming and control systems in academic programs of engineering and technology. The project was developed at the university Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios-UNIMINUTO ([https://www.uniminuto.edu/](https://www.uniminuto.edu/)) , Bogotá, Colombia, involving the programs of Technology in Electronics, Systems Engineering, and Industrial Engineering. *Smartlabsuniminuto* is available at https://www.smartlabsuniminuto.com/

The laboratory arose according to the educational problems regarding experimentation, hands-on activities, and learning by doing produced by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The laboratory is focused on programming through Python Language and a beta version for control systems education with a level control plant. Among the main features of *Smartlabsuniminuto*, we have:

###### Fig 1. Main feaures of smartlabsuniminuto.

With the laboratory, the students can program in Python language and interact with hardware devices which have been interfaced with a Raspberry Pi in each node. 

## 1.1 Programming modes
Searching to expand the scope of students that could use our laboratory, we developed two programming modes (text-based, block-based). 

### 1.1.1 Text-based programming
There, the students can program directly in Python Language. This mode could be used by students with experience in programming.

### 1.1.2 block-based programming
There, the students can program using graphical blocks (Blockly). This mode could be used by novice students.
