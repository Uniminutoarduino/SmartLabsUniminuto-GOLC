# SmartLabsUniminuto-GOLC

This is the online repository for the GOLC_2022 international award. In this repository, you can find the main information concerning the laboratory (smartlabsuniminuto), e.g., structure, features, modes of programming, educational goals and outcomes, and presentation video.

# 1. What is *Smartlabsuniminuto*?

*Smartlabsuniminuto*  is an initiative about remote laboratories for teaching and learning programming and control systems in academic programs of engineering and technology. The project was developed at the university Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios-UNIMINUTO ([https://www.uniminuto.edu/](https://www.uniminuto.edu/)) , Bogotá, Colombia, involving the programs of Technology in Electronics, Systems Engineering, and Industrial Engineering. *Smartlabsuniminuto* is available at https://www.smartlabsuniminuto.com/

The laboratory arose according to the educational problems regarding experimentation, hands-on activities, and learning by doing produced by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The laboratory is focused on programming through Python Language and a beta version for control systems education with a level control plant. With the laboratory, the students can program in Python language and interact with hardware devices which have been interfaced with a Raspberry Pi in each node (Physical Computing). The remote laboratory is available in Spanish. Among the main features of *Smartlabsuniminuto*, we have:

## 1.1 Programming modes
Searching to expand the scope of students that could use our laboratory, we developed two programming modes (text-based, block-based). Please, click on the images to see the videos in YouTube.

### 1.1.1 Text-based programming
There, the students can program directly in Python Language. This mode could be used by students with experience in programming or who desire to know the statements and structure of Python.

### 1.1.2 blocks-based programming
There, the students can program using graphical blocks (Blockly). This mode could be used by novice students.

## 1.2 Hardware
We have developed a low-cost module in a 3D printer to emsamble the different hardware elements employed in each node. Also, each module (0-17) counts with a robotic arm with 2 Degree of Freedom (DOF).
